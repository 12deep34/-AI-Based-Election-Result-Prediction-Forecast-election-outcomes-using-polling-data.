# Forecasting the 2019 Lok Sabha Election using Machine Learning and Data Analysis

This Python project seeks to forecast the election results of the General Election, 2019 in India using Data Analysis and Machine Learning. 


## Description

The General Election in India which will be contested for 545 seats in the Lok Sabha. 

Major focus would be given to a potential extended alliances that may be the deciding factor in the contest. 

Data Analysis would be used to parametrize computations such as coalitions and swings on all the seats. After that, Machine Learning algorithms such as Linear Regression can be utilized to calculate the aforementioned swing parameters using past election data specific to the relevant seats.

A large corpus of recent articles and/or twitter tweets can be used to calculate moods relevant to the elections. With the appropriate biases based on subjective data, we may be able to apply swings to the vote shares of each party in each constituency, and obtain viable forecasts.

Objective
To predict the 2019 Indian General Election results based on historical voting patterns.

To model the effect of alliances and coalitions among political parties.

To apply swing analysis to simulate changes in vote shares.

To use machine learning techniques for refining swing predictions.

Tools and Technologies Used
Jupyter Notebook — For executing and managing the project code.

Python — Programming language used for data analysis and modeling.

Pandas — For reading, cleaning, and manipulating election datasets.

WEKA (Optional) — For performing machine learning-based swing predictions.

Matplotlib/Seaborn (Optional) — For data visualization if required.

Workflow
Step 1: Data Preparation
Historical election data is collected, constituency-wise.
The dataset includes party-wise vote shares, total votes polled, and winning margins for different regions.

Step 2: Coalition Formation
Potential alliances are created by combining the vote shares of allied parties.
Vote shares are recalculated accordingly for each constituency.

Step 3: Swing Calculation
Swing refers to the percentage change in votes from the previous election.
Swings are simulated or calculated using:

Sentiment analysis from news or social media (optional)

Historical trend analysis

Manual input based on hypothetical scenarios

The adjusted vote shares reflect these swing values.

Step 4: Winner Prediction
For each constituency:

The party (or coalition) with the highest adjusted vote share is declared the predicted winner.

Step 5: Machine Learning (Optional)
Linear Regression or similar models are applied to predict swing values based on historical election patterns.
WEKA can also be used for advanced swing prediction.

Features
Constituency-wise Prediction
Predicts winners for each Lok Sabha seat individually.

Coalition Simulation
Allows modeling of different political alliances and their impact on results.

Dynamic Swing Adjustment
Enables user-driven simulation of vote swings.

Data-Driven Forecasting
Provides a structured, analytical method for election forecasting.

6. How to Run the Project
Install required packages:


pip install pandas jupyter

Launch Jupyter Notebook:


jupyter notebook
Open the file Election Swing Prediction.ipynb.

Run all cells in the notebook sequentially to see the election forecasting results.

(Optional) Use WEKA for additional machine learning modeling if desired.

Future Enhancements
Integrating real-time sentiment analysis from Twitter or news articles.

Using advanced machine learning models such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting for better prediction accuracy.

Including visualizations like constituency maps and interactive charts for enhanced presentation.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how election outcomes can be forecasted by combining historical data, political alliances, and machine learning techniques.
It highlights the critical role of small shifts in voter behavior and alliances in determining election results, and provides a structured approach for political data analysis and forecasting.
